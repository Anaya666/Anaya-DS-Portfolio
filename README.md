Portfolio Overview
This portfolio showcases two representative data science projects that demonstrate my ability to design end-to-end data pipelines and apply modern machine learning methods to real-world problems. 
The first project is a NYTimes Newsroom Streaming Pipeline, where I built a production-style ingestion and analytics system using the NYTimes Newswire API to study newsroom publishing velocity and 
metadata behavior over time. The pipeline includes scheduled API polling, deduplication, data cleaning, storage in DuckDB, and time-series analysis to uncover publishing surges, section-level patterns,
update lag, and topic dynamics using article metadata. The second project is a Machine Learning analysis of student math performance, completed as the final project for DS 4021, where I implemented and 
compared Elastic Net, Support Vector Regression, Gradient Boosting, and a PyTorch neural network to predict academic outcomes using socioeconomic and behavioral variables. Through cross-validation, 
model evaluation, and feature importance analysis, this project identifies the most influential predictors of student success and highlights how machine learning can inform equitable educational 
interventions. Together, these projects reflect my strengths in data systems, analytics, modeling, and translating quantitative insights into meaningful conclusions.
