Portfolio Overview
This portfolio showcases three representative data science projects that demonstrate my ability to design end-to-end data pipelines, apply modern machine learning methods, and conduct rigorous quantitative analysis on real-world problems.
The first project is a NYTimes Newsroom Streaming Pipeline, where I built a production-style ingestion and analytics system using the NYTimes Newswire API to study newsroom publishing velocity and metadata behavior over time. The pipeline includes scheduled API polling, deduplication, data cleaning, storage in DuckDB, and time-series analysis to uncover publishing surges, section-level patterns, update lag, and topic dynamics using article metadata.
The second project is a Machine Learning analysis of student math performance, completed as the final project for DS 4021. In this project, I implemented and compared Elastic Net, Support Vector Regression, Gradient Boosting, and a PyTorch neural network to predict academic outcomes using socioeconomic and behavioral variables. Through cross-validation, model evaluation, and feature importance analysis, the project identifies the most influential predictors of student success and demonstrates how machine learning can inform equitable educational interventions.
The third project is a Multi-Asset Portfolio Analytics & Optimization framework, where I constructed and evaluated equal-weight, mean–variance, and risk-parity portfolios using over eight years of historical market data across multiple asset classes. The analysis incorporates risk-adjusted performance metrics, drawdown analysis, rolling Sharpe ratios, regime-based performance evaluation, and benchmarking against a traditional 60/40 portfolio, highlighting trade-offs between return, risk concentration, and downside protection.
Together, these projects reflect my strengths in data systems, analytics, statistical modeling, and translating quantitative insights into clear, decision-relevant conclusions.
